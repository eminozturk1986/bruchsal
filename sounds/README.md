# Audio Files for Frankfurt Quest

This folder should contain the following audio files:

- `correct.wav` - Sound played when user answers correctly
- `wrong.wav` - Sound played when user answers incorrectly  
- `arrival.wav` - Sound played when user arrives at GPS location

## Creating Audio Files

You can create simple 8-bit style audio files using:

1. **Online generators:**
   - jfxr.frozenfractal.com
   - sfxr.me
   - freesound.org

2. **Suggested sound types:**
   - **correct.wav**: Success chime, coin pickup, or level up sound
   - **wrong.wav**: Error buzz, failure sound, or game over blip
   - **arrival.wav**: Achievement unlock, location found, or quest complete

3. **File format:** WAV files work best for web compatibility

## Fallback

The game will work without audio files - sound errors are caught and logged silently.
